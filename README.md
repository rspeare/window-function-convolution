# Window-function-convolution

This set of python routines prepares something I call the G-matrix, which converts unconvolved Power Spectra to Convolved Power Spectra.
Given an initial set of observed Power Spectrum values, at discrete k bins, $\lbrace P_k \rbrace_{k=k_\mathrm{min}}^{k_\mathrm{max}}$, one gets
the convolved Power Spectrum values by contracting against the matrix $G_{k,q}$.
