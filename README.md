# Window-function-convolution

This is a set of python routines to do the following things:

(1) regressor.py

Uses Gaussian Process framework with a very limited number of kernels to interpolate a given function -- or stochastic process -- sampled at discrete input output pairs.

(2) wjField.py

Uses Gaussian Process Kernels -- once again, a very limited number -- to convolve with some given Window function such that a convolved Gaussian process
can be interpolated and/or defined. 

(3) Estimator.py

A very fast Power Spectrum and Bispectrum Estimator, written in python.
